			<p>For our AENG 110 Infographic project we were tasked with making an infographic about a topic we choose from in a list of communication technologies. I choose the Optical Computer mouse. For this project I researched the optical mouse and learned how it works and the crazy amount of information it can process in a small amount of time.<br><br> For the project I used InDesign to create the graphic. I used images from the internet to represent what information I was trying to convey. I used a solid color for the background, and for my images and texts I used a fade effect to look like the images are fading into the background orange color. I also faded the text boxes so you could clearly see where they were, and I thought it made it easier to read. After than we sized and printed them and had a contest, the class picked their favorite one. I did not win but I really enjoyed this project and had fun doing it. </p>
