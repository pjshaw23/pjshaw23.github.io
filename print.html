			<p>For our AENG 110 Print Project, we made bookmarks for the local elementary school in the Penn Manor School District. First, we sketched multiple different ideas of bookmarks 5 to be exact. We then picked out what we thought was our best design and got to work making them in InDesign. For my project I used clip art to make my design, I went for a pirate themed design with a pirate ship, a hook and bird, and a pile of books. The caption read Explore the World through reading, then had the Penn Manor School District logo to the side.<br><br>After all our designs were final and done, we made a printing plate then had all 5 group members designs on it. Then once the plate was done drying and ready to be used, we installed the printing plate into the offset flexography print machine. Loaded it with ink and solution then let it run and we made about 150 copies of the bookmarks. Once they had all been printed, we took it over and cut it to certain dimensions for the bookmark size. Then Dr. Snyder sent them to the elementary school so the kids could use them. </p>
